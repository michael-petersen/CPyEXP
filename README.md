### python analysis of exp files (cpp routines)


#### Version 0.01
A collection of C++ routines that will eventually be turned into something real, hopefully.

Currently, the included toolbox has
1. area_calculate: Delaunay triangulation
2. cylcache: generate empirical orthogonal functions as per Weinberg 1999
3. twopower: build simple two-power density models
4. ic_generation/

   1. forcetrace: template for slicing across EXP dumps efficiently. requires EXP support

	2. basicics
   
	   1. DiskHalo5.cc

	   2. DiskHalo5.h
	   
   3. bulgeics:
	   
	   1. DiskHalo6.cc

	   2. DiskHalo5.h
	   
   4. flexics:
	   
   5. table_disk:
	   
   6. exponential3.h
