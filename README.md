### python analysis of exp files (cpp routines)


#### Version 0.01
A collection of C++ routines that will eventually be turned into something real, hopefully.

Currently, the included toolbox has
1. area_calculate: Delaunay triangulation
2. forcetrace: template for slicing across EXP dumps efficiently. requires EXP support
3. twopower: build simple two-power density models
